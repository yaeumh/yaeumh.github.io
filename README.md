I started being a Blink (BLACKPINK's fandom name) dating back at 2020 when I've first listened to their song;

"How You Like That"

...and then I started stanning (being a fan of) other korean groups/bands/artists too!
My second favorite band is NCT Dream, here's my favorite song of them:

"Hello Future"
